With such a tight playoff race in the 2023-24 season, it got me wondering what would have happened if the NHL worked on the IIHF system of 3 points for a win, 2 for an OT win, 1 for an OT/SO loss and 0 for a regulation loss.  The Bruins and the NY Islanders both had a lot of OT losses (15 and 16 respectfully), whereas Edmonton and Dallas both had 8 OT wins, but the Red Wings had a staggering 11.

So, to answer this, I decided to build my own version of the NHL Standings, but this one you can edit the points awarded for all types of results.  Whilst doing this, I also realised that the NHL Standings don't do a great job of showing the tiebreakers they use.  The first tiebreaker of fewest games played is usually less relevant than the next - the greater number of Regulation Wins.
