###Â Intro
The first thing you need when wanting to look at NHL data is NHL data.  Unfortunately there isn't too much documentation, but there is an API and resources (like https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference) which help along the way.

The main things I wanted to achieve was a table with all actions.  For every shot, hit, goal etc. I wanted a table with all of the possible informatiion.  This could then be supplemented with standings information, roster information etc.

### Pulling the data
There are many different ways to do this.  My preference is to run python script in JupyterLab within Anaconda:
<div style="text-align:center;">
    ![AnacondaScreenshot](/assets/img/AnacondaScreenshot.png)
</div>

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
